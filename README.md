This repository contains data based projects done for course work for my Data Science Certificate through the University of Waterloo as well as projects done for self interest. They will be separated into two separate folders with each folder containing a description of what was done. All data sets used for these projects will be uploaded with the projects themselves here.  

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me at s.thomas@queensu.ca
